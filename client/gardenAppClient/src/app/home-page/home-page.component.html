        <h3>Our Space</h3>
        <p>
          The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Give him a friend, we forget the trees
          get
          lonely too. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Now we
          don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

          Here we're limited by the time we have. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless
          you've
          known sorrow. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. It's so
          important
          to do something every day that will make you happy. And maybe, maybe, maybe... You gotta think like a tree.

          Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of
          Sap
          Green. See there how easy that is. Let's get crazy. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy
          bunch.
        </p>
        <p>Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. How to paint.
          That's
          easy. What to paint. That's much harder. It's important to me that you're happy.

          You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of
          it.
          And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Absolutely no pressure.
          You
          are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around
          and
          have fun. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. It's cold, but it's beautiful.
